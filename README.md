<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The project implements a collaborative code editor that uses React for front-end, express for back-end and WebSocket technology for real-time communication. Users can join in a shared room where they can collaboratively edit code. The use of web sockets ensures that any changes made by one user are instantly visible to others in the same room.
This real-time synchronization allows multiple individuals to work together seamlessly on a single codebase, promoting effective collaboration without the need for constant manual refreshing or reloading of the page.
